🎧 Live Vibe Room — Real-Time Listening, Reactions & Vibes
Live Vibe Room is not just another Spotify clone —
It’s a shared listening universe.
A real-time, interactive, emotionally-charged experience where music becomes a conversation, not just a play button.

🚀 What Is It?
Live Vibe Room is a high-impact feature layered inside a Spotify-inspired web app. It allows users to:

🔴 Join or create real-time listening rooms

🎶 Share music, emotions, and energy — together

💬 React with emojis, chat, and mood votes (🔥 🎧 💔 🌙)

🎨 Toggle light/dark themes that persist with localStorage

⚡️ Enjoy buttery-smooth performance with lazy loading, input debouncing, and no page refreshes

📱 Access it anywhere with a fully responsive design

This isn’t just a UI.
It’s a digital campfire where people vibe, connect, and feel — together.

💡 Why This Is Different
Spotify lets you stream music.
Live Vibe Room lets you stream feelings.

No one nailed the social layer of listening. We did it:

No backend? No problem.
All real-time logic is mocked to perfection.

Built with front-end finesse using Socket.IO, JS, and Next-level UI polish.

UX that makes you go: “Wait, how is this not a real Spotify feature yet?”
